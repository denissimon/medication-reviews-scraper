No weight gain, no bloating, no cramps, no acne. However, ive been trying generics now looking for something to stop thos emotional rollercoaster ive realized ive been on since starting.  I was always cool, calm, and collected.  Now i drove people nuts with my constant anxiety and crying, then extreme levels of happiness.  Honestly i feel bipolar. This costs me 146 dollars a month, i cant pay that to be crazy, but if i cant find a suitable medication that fixes acne and cramps and doesnt cause weight gain, then i will go back to yaz.", "sex": "F", "age": "26", "duration_and_dosage": "3  years / 3/.2", "date added": "11/26/2019"}, {"medication": "\nYAZ", "link": "https://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=21676&name=YAZ", "rating": "1", "reason": "Stop pregnancy, irregular periods", "side_effects": "Horrible cystic acne, recurrent bv/yeast infections", "comments": "Yaz has honestly got to be the WORST birth control pill I\u0092ve taken to date.
