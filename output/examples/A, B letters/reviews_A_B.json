I told my doctor all this and he just said I needed it and he was overweight himself so why worry?  I thought maybe he was right because members of my family started gaining weight as they got older.  Finally I got so frustrated about the weight gain that I thought I'd try to stop taking the pill myself.  So I took half a pill for awhile and then I took 1/4 of it.

It was while taking advair that my hair started to fall out. During that time mother and I didnt know the reason why. I only found out why 9 years later when I couldn't afford the medicine for three months and my hair started growing back. Unfortinately that was too long without it and I ended up being hospitalized. I was able to get a free advair from the hospital and immediately after I took the first dose my hair started to fall out in chuncks. Another side effect of advair was that if I missed one dose I would immediately develop a cold. And since I was forgetful that was a normal occurance for me. And if I missed a full day I suffered severe asthma symptoms within 8 hours (think school days) of the missed dose and would need to be rushed to hospital for treatment. If I had albuterol I could extend the time it takes before I have to be rushed to the hospital, but even then it's pure torture surviving like that. For the albuterol does not help for long (minutes) and it doesn't help with all of the symptoms.One last thing I noticed was that even though it was helpful during the day. It was very unhelpful in terms of dealing with my exercise induced asthma. Any type of running for a minute was impossible because immediately my asthma would act up.

Because of slight heart irregularity in the hospital I was put on this drug.  Looking back on it, I think it began to affect me badly from the very beginning.  My skin began to itch and I had sleeping problems before leaving the hospital (6 days).  After I got home the rash and itching increased to the point of misery, and I got very short of breath and could barely walk across the room.  I alternated between constipation and diarrhea.  I went back to my cardiologist and also my primary care doctor and tried to ask about drug side effects, but they both blew me off.  Told me my heart was \"fine\" and I had nothing to worry about!  I have fired both of them and found a new doctor who listens to me when I talk about symptoms.  This is a dangerous drug that is prescribed, in my opinion, by doctors who have become nothing but money-grubbing drug dealers who don't have time to be real doctors.

Unfortunately he still has at least one or two serious episodes per year that generally turn into pneumonia. His Dr. switched him to Asmanex hoping to avoid these issues. After just a few days my normally easy going docile son, was getting reports sent home from his teacher that he was \"acting out\" in class, not concentrating, and unable to keep his hands and feet to himself. I assumed he was having trouble adjusting to Kindergarten , although found it odd that he did very well for the first month, and starting having problems in the second month. I noticed he was acting strangely at home as well..Being very short tempered with his twin brother, not sitting well at the dinner table , not sleeping well, and having tantrums. All of these things are TERRIBLY out of character.  Only after a full three weeks did my husband say \"He is acting like he does when he is on that steroid.\" (he has behavioral issues whenever he is very ill and has to do a round of prednisone)... It was like a lightbulb went off over my head! I took him off of the Asmanex and returned to using the Pulmicort. Within two days his teacher said he was a completely different child! She confided in me that she was actually preparing to contact me for a meeting to discuss the possibility of testing for ADHD, or even to see if my son was on the autism spectrum.

I went to the Dr. & she insisted my body telling me I still needed to take it because it showed how anxious I was.  She wanted me to go back up to the original dose.  I refused.  2 yrs later I tried weaning down .25 mg, but that is very problematic. If I don't get the med within 24 hrs, I start to go into withdrawal.  I still get horrible nightmares.

I started seeing an infectious disease specialist about 1 year ago and she thought that these lumps/mass were staph infections and I was treated with antibiotics. Most times it would take 3 - 10 day courses on antibiotics to clear them up. This last lump, which has not gone away was treated with a total of 54 days of antibiotics. She is now thinking they may be Rheumatoid  Nodules. I did test positive for RA but very low on the scale. I have had sonograms on one of the lumps on my arm, and on my breast. The results come back that they are injuries or bruises. Also, my memory has been awful for the last year.

In this way you give each site at least 12 days rest.
